        <h2>Mom's Charcoal and Grill Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Mum's Charcoal & Grill opened its doors in December 2016 at Pialba Place, 
          introducing authentic charcoal-grilled cuisine to Hervey Bay. The idea was born 
          in 2015, when two brothers visited the region and immediately felt at home. 
          Hervey Bay's relaxed lifestyle, friendly community, and climate reminded them 
          of their hometown of Pokhara, Nepal. What they could not find, however, was a 
          place that served the style of charcoal chicken they had grown up enjoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          With prior experience in the charcoal chicken industry, they saw an opportunity 
          to bring something new to the local dining scene. The name Mum's Charcoal & Grill 
          was chosen to reflect the values of home-style cookingâ€”fresh, wholesome meals 
          prepared with the same care and attention as in a family kitchen.
